# Dot
A simple platformer game, based on my Scratch project "Dot: Return" https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/412149960. Built with C# using [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp), a cross-platform 2D drawing library.
## BassClefStudio.Dot.Game
A basic UWP project, which allows you to open and play game files saved as JSON, using either a text editor or the built-in editor UI in the Scratch project. Games run at full resolution and up to 60fps.
