# Dot
A simple platformer game, based on my Scratch project ["Dot: Return"](https://github.com/bassclefstudio/Dot-Scratch) ([link to Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/412149960)). Built with C# using [BassClefStudio.Graphics](https://github.com/bassclefstudio/Graphics-Libraries), a cross-platform 2D drawing library.
## BassClefStudio.Dot.Game
A basic UWP project, which allows you to open and play game files saved as JSON, using either a text editor or the built-in editor UI in the Scratch project. Games run at full resolution and up to 60fps.
